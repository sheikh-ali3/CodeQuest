Project Title:
NLP-Based Clinical Code Dictionary Web App for ICD-9, ICD-10, CPT, HCPCS, SNOMED, LOINC, and HCC

üìå Project Overview:
Develop a web application that allows users to search for and retrieve medical codes and descriptions (ICD-9, ICD-10, CPT, HCPCS, SNOMED CT, LOINC, HCC) by code or free-text description. The application should support:

Exact and Similar Search

Smart NLP Matching

CSV-based Upload for Data Ingestion

Search via uploaded CSV

Search Suggestions and Synonyms

üë• Target Users:
Healthcare providers

Medical coders & billing staff

Clinical researchers

Medical transcriptionists

Health IT system administrators

üß† Core Functionalities:
üîç Search Capabilities:
Search by Code (e.g., E11.9, 99213, etc.)

Search by Description (e.g., ‚ÄúType 2 Diabetes Mellitus‚Äù)

Return Exact + Fuzzy Matches

NLP-driven similarity scoring using:

Tokenization

Synonym recognition

TF-IDF or BERT Embeddings

Cosine similarity

üìÅ CSV Upload Features:
Admin can upload CSV files for each code system (ICD-9, ICD-10, etc.)

Fields: code, description, category (optional), synonyms (optional)

Users can upload a CSV file to search multiple codes or terms in one go

üìä Frontend (React.js)
Pages & Components:
Home Page

Quick search bar (code or description)

Recent or popular searches

Search Results Page

Table view of results with:

Code System

Code

Description

Match Score (if fuzzy)

Filter by Code Type (ICD10, CPT, etc.)

Upload Page (Admin & User)

Upload CSV (Drag & Drop or Select)

Preview and import data

Upload CSV for bulk search

Admin Panel

Upload and manage data sources

View upload logs

About / Help Page

UI Libraries:
Tailwind CSS or Material UI

React Table

React Dropzone

React Router DOM

üîê Authentication (Optional Phase):
JWT-based Login/Signup

Role-Based Access:

Admin

User

üóÉÔ∏è Backend (Node.js + Express)
API Endpoints:
Method	Route	Purpose
POST	/api/upload/data	Admin upload clinical code CSV
POST	/api/upload/search	User uploads CSV to search multiple entries
POST	/api/search	Search by text/code
GET	/api/search/:codeType	Filter by ICD10, CPT, etc.
GET	/api/code/:id	Fetch individual code detail
GET	/api/stats	Stats like # of codes per system

Middleware:
File upload validation (using multer)

CSV to JSON parser (csv-parser)

Error handling

Token-based access control

üß± Database (MongoDB Schema Design)
Collection: clinical_codes
json
Copy
Edit
{
  _id: ObjectId,
  code_type: "ICD-10" | "ICD-9" | "CPT" | "HCPCS" | "SNOMED" | "LOINC" | "HCC",
  code: "E11.9",
  description: "Type 2 diabetes mellitus without complications",
  synonyms: ["T2DM", "Diabetes Mellitus Type II"],
  category: "Endocrine Disorders",
  created_at: ISODate,
  updated_at: ISODate
}
üß† NLP Logic (Node.js or Python Microservice)
Option 1: Built-in JS NLP (Fast, lighter)
Use natural, fuse.js, or string-similarity libraries

TF-IDF, Levenshtein, Cosine Similarity for fuzzy search

Option 2: Python Microservice (Better results)
Use Flask/FastAPI microservice

Spacy, sentence-BERT, Scikit-learn, NLTK

REST API endpoints for processing search queries

üîÑ Search Result Ranking (Score Breakdown)
Component	Weight
Exact Match	1.0
Synonym Match	0.8
Token Match	0.6
Semantic Similarity	0.7 - 0.9 (based on cosine similarity)
